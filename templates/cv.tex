\subject{Application for the position of Interim Programme Lead for Law}
\makelettertitle

It is with pleasure that I submit my application for interim Programme Lead for Law.

While the sentence `We are living in times of change' is very much a worn out clich\'e at the start of student dissertations, it is certainly true when it comes to the provision of law degrees in England and Wales. 

The position of Programme Lead for Law would be an ideal step for my career progression at this stage. The position has the potential to add to my experiences in a number of exciting areas. The challenges posed by the SRA and the lack of a coherent position across Law Schools in England and Wales bring a potential to make Oxford Brookes stand out as a practice oriented, yet critical and academic law school. Being able to contribute to the academic programmes at such a crucial time would be a great opportunity for me.

% Points to mention
% SQE
% Career development

I am pleased to submit my application for the position of Senior Lecturer in Law at Oxford Brookes University.

In the past seven years, I have worked together with a small team and helped to develop the Law Programmes at Canterbury Christ Church University from a nascent project into a well functioning law provision with a stable intake of students and very successful alumni. At this stage of my career, I am looking for new challenges. I believe that the Law School of Oxford Brookes University is an ideal place to find these challenges and to live up to my full potential. Oxford Brookes comes from a similar background to Canterbury Christ Church, but is more ambitious in terms of growth, postgraduate provision and research, and these are all areas that I would like to progress in myself.

At Canterbury Christ Church, I have taken on the responsibility for the academic side of the undergraduate law provision. As the Programme Director, I have developed new degree pathways, have re-structured and strengthened the existing ones and have implemented and changed the procedures to ensure a frictionless operation of high quality degrees. Christ Church has given me the opportunity to take on various areas of academic management, including establishing international co-operations, managing budgets, mentoring of staff members, distributing workloads and leading a team of passionate teachers. I have also been involved in curriculum planning and development on University level and have gathered many insights through my work at other institutions. I am very willing to take on similar responsibilities at Oxford Brookes and to help the Law School with the challenges posed by Brexit and the changes implemented by the Solicitor Regulation Authority.

I am a very passionate teacher, and my lectures, seminars and workshops have received highly positive feedback from both colleagues and students. I have been nominated by students for teaching awards both at the University of Kent and at Canterbury Christ Church, and I believe I have made even less crowd-pleasing subjects like Constitutional or European Law a fun experience for many of our students. My subject specialism is in the wider area of public law, and I would be happy to contribute (or lead) any related subject on undergraduate and postgraduate level, and also to supervise PhDs in related fields. I am currently in the process of applying for Senior Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy, and this process should be completed by the time my contract at Oxford Brookes would start.

Oxford Brookes' Law School is renown for its exceptionally high rate of student satisfaction, and I would relish the opportunity to contribute to this. For me, the student experience has always been of the utmost importance, and I have worked hard to create a joyful and intimate experience for both our students and the teachers. Besides small things like organising garden parties or film nights, I have organised yearly trips with my International and European Law students to a large range of European and International institutions across Europe that were always very well received by the students, and I would love to set up a similar trip at Oxford Brookes.

The strong focus on pro bono work is another outstanding feature of the School of Law at Oxford Brookes, and another area I would like to be able to contribute to. Canterbury Christ Church became, despite its very low student numbers, one of the first institutions to take part in the `Community Legal Outreach Collaboration Keele' programme, a programme that allows students to assist some of the rising number of litigants in person that are often lost within the court system. I would be quite interested to explore the possibility to adopt a similar project at Oxford Brookes.

I also believe that the strong academic environment at Oxford Brookes University will help me to focus on producing more research output. I have recently published a paper on the use of force in international law, and hope to complete two projects in international and European Law over the summer. The international focus of the postgraduate programmes at Oxford Brookes and the strong focus on research among staff members (including an International Law Research Group) will help me to improve my research portfolio.

I hope my application will be of interest to the panel.

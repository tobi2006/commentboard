#Commentboard

This application is supposed to allow participants in events to give quick, anonymous comments.

The original idea was to use this for University lectures: students tend to be very shy during lectures, and this can be a way to allow them to give feedback / questions and to vote on the existing comments, all of this with their phone / tablet / laptop. The lecturer can keep an eye on these comments from time to time, delete inappropriate ones and react to the good ones.

The application has not yet been tested in the real world, but this will be done this year.
